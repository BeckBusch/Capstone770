\chapter{Conclusion}

To conclude, our proposed solution should ease the weighing sessions for the staff of SPCA. The proposed solution delivers two main products. The first is the scale itself which will be used to weigh the dogs and measure their weight.  The second is the web platform that allows users to visualise and easily manage all the data being processed and stored in the backend.

As discussed in this report, our proposed solution not only offers a viable product that increases efficiency but also caters for the different cultural, environmental, legal and ethical requirements surrounding the project. 

The proposed solution should allow users to focus solely on the animal being cared for without worrying about the technical aspects. The scale should be straightforward to use and the data processed in the backend should also be easy to mange by the user through the provided platform. Overall, the automated process should bring the user more comfort whilst still maintaining its accuracy and reliability.
